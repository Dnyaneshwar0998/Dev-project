# Prerequisites
#
- JDK 11 
- Maven 3 
- MySQL 8

Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Provision AWS EC2 Instances:

Launch EC2 instances on AWS (ensure the instance has proper access and security settings).
Choose an appropriate AMI (Amazon Machine Image) like Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.
Install necessary software (Java, Git, Jenkins, Maven, etc.) on your EC2 instance.
Install Jenkins:

SSH into your EC2 instance.
Install Jenkins by adding the Jenkins repository and installing it via the package manager.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/ stable main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
Start Jenkins and enable it to start on boot:


sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Access Jenkins through http://<EC2-public-ip>:8080 and complete the initial setup.
Set Up Git Repositories:

Create and configure a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) to store the source code.
Configure the repository in Jenkins to link your project code.
Step 2: Install and Configure Necessary Jenkins Plugins
Install Required Plugins in Jenkins:
Go to Jenkins dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
Install the following plugins:
Git Plugin (for integrating with Git repositories)
Maven Integration Plugin (for building Java projects using Maven)
Slack Notification Plugin (for sending notifications to Slack)
SonarQube Scanner for Jenkins (for integrating SonarQube for code quality analysis)
Configure Global Tools in Jenkins:
Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration.
Set up tools like Maven (point to the installed version) and JDK (Java Development Kit).
Step 3: Set Up SonarQube for Code Quality Checks
Install SonarQube:

Install SonarQube either on the EC2 instance or as a cloud service.
Set up SonarQube by following the installation guide on their official website.
Configure SonarQube in Jenkins:

Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Scroll down to find the SonarQube section, and add the details of your SonarQube instance (server URL, authentication token).
Install and configure the SonarQube Scanner in the Jenkins global tool configuration.
Integrate SonarQube Analysis in Jenkins Pipeline:

Step 4: Create Jenkins Pipeline Job for CI/CD
Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job:
In Jenkins, create a new item and select "Pipeline."
Configure the job to pull from the Git repository.
Configure the Jenkinsfile:
Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your Git repository. This file will contain the steps for the CI pipeline.
This file should be committed to your repository.
Step 5: Set Up Slack Notifications
Create a Slack App and Get the Webhook URL:
Go to Slack API and create a new app.
Add the "Incoming Webhooks" feature and enable it.
Create a new Webhook URL for your Slack channel.
Configure Slack Notifications in Jenkins:
Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Find the "Slack" section and configure the Webhook URL.
Set up your Slack channel and other notification preferences.
Step 6: Set Up the Continuous Integration Pipeline
Push Changes to Git:

Push your changes to the Git repository.
Run the Jenkins Pipeline:

Once the changes are pushed, Jenkins should automatically trigger the pipeline.
The pipeline will build the project, run tests, analyze code with SonarQube, and deploy to AWS EC2.
Monitor Build Status:

You can monitor the build status on the Jenkins dashboard or in the Slack channel.
If the build fails, the failure message will be sent to the configured Slack channel.
Step 7: Test and Optimize
Test the Pipeline:
Verify that the pipeline is functioning correctly by pushing code changes and checking if the build, deployment, and notifications work as expected.
Optimize the Pipeline:
Make sure the pipeline is optimized for faster builds (e.g., caching dependencies, parallelizing tasks).
Integrate more advanced features like automatic rollback on failed deployments, unit tests, and performance tests.
